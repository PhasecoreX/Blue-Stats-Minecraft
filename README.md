# Blue-Stats-Minecraft
BlueStats is not your standard minecraft statistics panel. It is not made to support a single plugin, instead it is designed to support all of them. Through the use of plugins, BlueStats can be thought how to read the database layouts of bukkit/spigot plugins. Not only is it designed to display server statistics, it is designed to replace your server homepage to have a dynamically updating site with user statistics built right in!

BlueStats is expandable through the use of plugins and themes to suit your minecraft brand. While the included themes work out of the box, you are encouraged to create your own to advertise your server.

A live demo can be found here: https://stats.mysunland.org
